MAIN GOAL: Find profitable odds on NBA player props (i.e. LeBron James total
points, Trae Young assists, etc.)
1) Find a sportsbook with “sharp” (accurate) lines (we recommend Pinnacle)
2) Web scrape the odds from their website and store them with Python
3) “De-vig” the lines to reverse engineer an implied probability of the event
4) Find sportsbooks with lines that deviate significantly from these “true” lines
